Online-zoo is a platform that collects information about animals from various zoos with webcams. It is assumed that the user can open a page with zoo resources, watch one of the animals, or make a donation that will be used to purchase food.
As part of the task, I have made an adaptive layout and interactivity of the main page, and the page with donations.
